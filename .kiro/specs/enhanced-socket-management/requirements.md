# Requirements Document

## Introduction

You have an enhanced backend socket handler that supports organization-aware events, online presence tracking, and comprehensive real-time updates. The frontend socket management needs to be updated to properly handle all the events and features that your backend now supports.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want better socket connection reliability, so that I don't lose real-time updates when my internet connection is unstable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the socket disconnects THEN the system SHALL automatically try to reconnect
2. WHEN reconnecting fails THEN the system SHALL wait longer before trying again (exponential backoff)
3. WHEN the connection is restored THEN the system SHALL work normally again
4. WHEN I'm offline THEN the system SHALL show me that I'm disconnected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to only see updates relevant to my organizations, so that I don't get notifications about things I shouldn't see.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I receive real-time updates THEN the system SHALL only show me updates from my organizations
2. WHEN I see online users THEN the system SHALL only show users from organizations I belong to
3. WHEN patients are updated THEN the system SHALL only notify me if I have access to that patient
4. WHEN users are added/removed from organizations THEN the system SHALL update what I can see

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time updates for all the new features, so that I stay informed about changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN medical records are created or updated THEN the system SHALL show me real-time notifications
2. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL notify relevant people immediately
3. WHEN user roles change THEN the system SHALL update the interface immediately
4. WHEN organization settings change THEN the system SHALL reflect changes immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see who's online in my organizations, so that I know who I can collaborate with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users come online THEN the system SHALL show them as online immediately
2. WHEN users go offline THEN the system SHALL remove them from online lists
3. WHEN I request online users THEN the system SHALL show accurate counts per organization
4. WHEN I look at online status THEN the system SHALL only show users from my organizations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the socket system to handle all the new backend events, so that the frontend works with the enhanced backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend sends new event types THEN the frontend SHALL handle them properly
2. WHEN events have organization context THEN the frontend SHALL respect organization boundaries
3. WHEN the backend sends online user updates THEN the frontend SHALL update the UI correctly
4. WHEN the backend sends error responses THEN the frontend SHALL handle them gracefully
