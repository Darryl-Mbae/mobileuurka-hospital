# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to modernize the existing client-side socket management system to align with the enhanced server-side socket handler you've provided. The current implementation needs improvements in connection reliability, tenant-aware functionality, performance monitoring, and real-time status management to match the sophisticated server-side capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved socket connection reliability and error handling, so that the application maintains stable real-time communication even under network instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the socket connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff reconnection strategy
2. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and restore all subscriptions
3. WHEN connection errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery suggestions
4. WHEN the socket is disconnected THEN the system SHALL maintain a queue of pending events and replay them upon reconnection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates to be organization-aware, so that I only receive relevant information for my organization memberships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects THEN the system SHALL filter all real-time events based on user's organization memberships
2. WHEN organization membership changes THEN the system SHALL update event subscriptions accordingly
3. WHEN receiving online user updates THEN the system SHALL only show users from shared organizations
4. WHEN broadcasting events THEN the system SHALL validate tenant permissions before processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive socket event management, so that all real-time features work consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN medical records are created or updated THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to relevant organization members
2. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL notify appropriate organization administrators
3. WHEN user roles change THEN the system SHALL update permissions and subscriptions in real-time
4. WHEN patients are managed THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to authorized organization members only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate online presence indicators, so that I can see who is currently available in my organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users come online THEN the system SHALL update presence indicators for shared organization members
2. WHEN users go offline THEN the system SHALL remove them from online lists after appropriate timeout
3. WHEN requesting online users THEN the system SHALL return organization-filtered results
4. WHEN displaying online counts THEN the system SHALL show accurate numbers per organization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring and debugging capabilities, so that socket-related issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN socket events occur THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and timing information
2. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL capture detailed context for debugging
3. WHEN connection quality degrades THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
4. WHEN events are processed THEN the system SHALL track success/failure rates and response times

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent socket event handling with runtime validation, so that errors are caught early and development experience is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining socket events THEN the system SHALL use JSDoc comments and consistent patterns for all event payloads
2. WHEN emitting events THEN the system SHALL validate payload structure at runtime
3. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL provide consistent access to event data with validation
4. WHEN adding new events THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent naming and structure patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless socket state management integration, so that real-time updates are reflected consistently across all UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN socket events are received THEN the system SHALL update Redux state atomically
2. WHEN multiple related events occur THEN the system SHALL batch state updates to prevent UI flickering
3. WHEN components subscribe to socket events THEN the system SHALL provide React hooks for easy integration
4. WHEN socket state changes THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate UI re-renders efficiently
